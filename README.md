# Kotlin Libraries Playground

A playground to gain a wider and deeper knowledge of the libraries in the Kotlin ecosystem

Also the official sample for [gradle refreshVersions](https://github.com/jmfayard/refreshVersions)

### ü§îHow do you keep up with all the new stuff?

There are [great resources to learn Kotlin](https://dev.to/jmfayard/best-ways-to-learn-kotlin-from-scratch-or-from-java-with-books-or-tutorials-online-or-in-the-ide-52cm). 

But once you master the language, you are not done just yet.

You now face another challenging task: become familiar with its ecosystem of libraries.

With time, you want to both acquire

- a **wider** knowledge of what good libraries are available in the ecosystem in general
- a **deeper** knowledge of some specific libraries particulary important for you

There are several inefficient ways to do that:

- reading tutorial after tutorial and being stuck in a loop where you "learn" about things you don't practice
- starting a new project from scratch for every libraries you come around - overwhelming
- trying out the library in your main project at work - a project with a compilation time of 5 minutes, who uses an older version of the library than the tutorial assume ; not sure your colleagues will be happy that you introduce a dependency you don't yet master.

### ü¶ÖWidening your knowledge of libraries

The `kotlin-libraries-playgound` contains samples for a growing number of good Kotlin libraries including Moshi, Okio, OkHttp, Retrofit, Kotlinx Serialization, KoTest, Mockk, Spek, Strikt, ...

You are very welcome to contribute new samples (see below)

For each library we have a sample usage that is

- self-contained (own package and main function, usually one file)
- simple yet meaningful (no fancy coffee machine with [termosiphon](https://github.com/google/dagger/tree/master/examples/maven/coffee/src/main/java/example/dagger))

Here is for example the sample usage for [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization)

```kotlin
package playground.kotlinx.serialization

fun main() {
    println("# Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization : Kotlin multiplatform / multi-format serialization")
    val user = User(name = "Robert", age = 42)
    val json = """{"name":"Robert","age":42}"""

    Json.encodeToString(user) shouldBe json
    Json.decodeFromString<User>(json) shouldBe user
}

@Serializable
internal data class User(
    val name: String,
    val age: Int
)
```

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributors welcome! #hacktoberfest

The more good libraries we cover, the better!

You are very welcome to contribute your own library sample

## üî≠ Deepening your understanding of one library

Clone this repository and make it yours.

Want to learn more about, say, [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp)?

You don't have the hassle to create a new project.

Create a new **branch** called okhttp and try out things while you are reading the [documentation](https://square.github.io/okhttp/recipes/)

## üé© Easy dependency management with gradle refreshVersions

This playground is also the official sample for [gradle refreshVersions](https://github.com/jmfayard/refreshVersions)

It makes it super easy to refresh dependencies
